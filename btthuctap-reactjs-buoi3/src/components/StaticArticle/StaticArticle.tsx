          The landscape of web development is constantly evolving. New frameworks, libraries, and tools emerge at a rapid pace, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. From server-side rendering to the rise of static site generators and the ever-growing capabilities of CSS, developers have a powerful arsenal at their disposal.

          One of the most significant trends is the move towards component-based architecture, popularized by libraries like React. This modular approach allows for more reusable, maintainable, and scalable codebases. As we look to the future, we can expect to see even greater integration of AI, more immersive experiences with WebGL and WebXR, and a continued focus on performance and accessibility.
